{"name":"Azert Pipeline","tagline":"A simple synchronous pipeline utilising the pipes and filters pattern.","body":"### Welcome to the Azert Pipeline page!\r\nThis is a little project I put together very quickly when mocking up a new architecture for a system I was working. After reading various articles I decided the Pipes and Filters pattern was the best approach to take as it fitted very nicely with what I was trying to achieve.\r\n\r\nAfter reading various code examples I decided to try my hand at writing a very lightweight and simple Pipeline that I could use in my projects going forward, this is the result of that.\r\n\r\nIt is based roughly on this explaination from Microsoft [Pipes and Filters Pattern](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/dn568100.aspx)\r\n\r\n### Simple\r\nI did not need an ayncshronous or parallel pipeline so this is simply a synchronous pipeline, as in, it starts at the start and finishes at the end and processes each filter in turn.\r\n\r\nThere are very few methods to be aware of, in fact only two:\r\n\r\n`Pipeline.Register() & Pipeline.Execute()`\r\n\r\n### Extensible\r\nTo add a new filter simply implement IFilter and register with your Pipeline:\r\n\r\n`public class Lowercase : IFilter {\r\n        public int Order => 1;\r\n\r\n        public object Process(object input) {\r\n\r\n            Console.WriteLine(input.ToString().ToLowerInvariant());\r\n\r\n            return input;\r\n        }\r\n    }`\r\n\r\nAnd register:\r\n\r\n`pipeline.Register(new Lowercase());`\r\n\r\n### Future\r\nOne next step I will look at is adding a load balancer, this should allow a long running filter to have more than one implementation to speed up the pipeline.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project was created and maintained by @marknumskull. I am open to comments and suggestions to improve this going forward. My main hope is that someone finds it useful!\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nJust leave an issue on the GitHub page and @marknumskull will be sure to look at it","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
